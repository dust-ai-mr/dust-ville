<h1>Dust</h1>
<p>
    Dust is a software platform for building scalable systems based on the Actor paradigm. In particular we have engineered
    Dust so that it is an ideal platform for creating Digital Twins. A white paper on the technology can be found
    <a href="/static/dtwins3.pdf">here</a>.
</p>
<h1>Actors</h1>
<p>
    An Actor is a very lightweight, self-contained software process. Actors work by receiving messages sent to them by other Actors
    and processing them one at a time. As they do so they may change their internal state. The <i>only</i> way Actors
    can communicate is via sending and receiving messages - there is no other way to access their internal state.
</p>
<p>
    Actors are distributable and addressable and so a system of communicating Actors may span several hosts - from cloud
    based servers to small IOT devices, all intercommunicating via messages.
</p>
<p>
    Actors are <b>very</b> light weight. A typical application may have 100,000s of Actors all running simultaneously on
    quite modest hardware (e.g. a laptop). Actor messages can be delivered at the rate of millions per second.
</p>
<h1 style="clear:left">Dustville</h1>
<p>
    Dustville is a <i>VERY simple</i> demonstration of the capability of Dust to digitally twin an environment. It was
    designed to showcase the ideas behind Dust and not be a faithful model of a town or its road systems.
    In this case we are using both simulated and real-time data to model:
    <ul>
        <li>
            Birds - birds like to flock near the power plant and each of the approximately 100
            (boxy!) birds is modelled with an Actor. The volume they fly
            in is divided into 8000 cubes - each with its own Actor. Cube Actors and Bird Actors exchange message - the
            Cube Actor keeps a track of average motion of the birds in its volume and newly entering birds get given this
            information so they can try to match it and follow the averages. This simulates the flocking behavior. As
            birds move between the Cube Actors the Cube Actors send messages to their neighbors to 'hand off' the bird
            and the bird then starts to follow the motion in its new neighborhood.
            <br>
            This behavior is somewhat similar to ...
        </li>
        <li>Cars - each Car is represented by a set of Actors which know its position and speed. Part of its predefined
            behavior is to match speed with the local traffic conditions and periodically to 'go home'. Also the
            cars are EVs - so they know they have to periodically stop at a charging station</li>
        <li>
            Roads - each Road is modelled by Actors - they know where their cars are and how congested the road is. Part
            of the Road-Actor's state is whether or not the road is open. If it is closed the Road-Actor exchanges messages
            with Car Actors which might want to enter the road to prevent them from doing so.
        </li>
        <li>
            Intersections - Intersection Actors know which roads converge on them. They also help model EV charging at
            charging stations on their periphery. As more cars charge the power levels go up and the intersection sends power
            level messages to ..
        </li>
        <li>
            Power Station - receives power requirement messages from the Charging Station Actors and delivers more power
            accordingly. This can cause the powerstation to catch fire occasionally because not only are charging stations
            drawing power but so are
        </li>
        <li>
            Houses - Each House has a solar cells on its roof (which vary from house to house). When the sun is shining Houses
            deliver power to the power station. Also each House Actor decides whether or not it needs to turn on heating
            or cooling depending on the internal temperature of the house.
            Each House Actor models a random degree of insulation and so the internal temperature
            depends on the external temperature which comes from ..
        </li>
        <li>
            Weather Station - this is a real-time Actor which is taking information (via the Internet) from the
            weather.com API. It converts temperature and daylight intensity data into Actor messages
            which it then broadcasts to any other 'interested' Actors - in this case the House and scene Actors.
            House Actors  use the temperature measurement to model their internal temperature and uses light intensity
            to determine how much power it is contributing to the power station. The Scene Actor models the lighting for ...
        </li>
        <li>
            The 3D UI - All of the above is taking place in the cloud. Messages being
            created by these Actors are funneled through a WebSocket to the browser which is simply responsible for
            rendering the 3D scene. Finally ..
        </li>
        <li>
            We are running an open-source ChatGPT like server. Periodically the TownActor asks the server to
            provide a new local news story. We had to get AI in here somehow ;)
        </li>

    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    In total, then, Dustville is modelled by about 10000 individual self-managing Actors and uses a mixture of real-world and
    simulated data.
